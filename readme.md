# Hodulcine (Work in progress)

Hodulcine is a sweet receptor inhibitor, it has nothing to do with this project, I've just been fascinated by taste and perception lately.
This project is a chrome/firefox plugin to sync opened tabs in real time (based on event triggers exposed by the chromium api).
While there are other real-time tab sync projects currently on the chrome app store, I've found them to be either buggy beyond the point of frustration, and I'm sure others have experienced the same issues.
The goal here is to do it the right way <sup>tm</sup>, keep it simple, get it done, and leave it be.
